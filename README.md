# Openmark
Let's make our bookmarks public.

## Why Openmark
We can now publicize and share the tweets we bookmarked in our own professional area. Why should we do this? We bring the bookmarks that we buried deep to the surface.

## How will we use it?
You will login with our Twitter account. You can accept the necessary conditions, choose the ones you want to make public, click the share button and throw your bookmarks to the world.

## How to contribute?
Openmark is an open source project. You can contribute to the project by reporting bugs, suggesting new features, and sending pull requests. You can also help by translating the project to your native language. You can find more information about contributing to the project in the contributing guidelines.
